For this SBA I created two projects

The first is a booking site that uses an api to access the information from booking.com using React and Redux
I made a simple easy to use website that will provide you with hotel details for any city you want.
Simply click book trip in the navbar and enter your destination city, then enter your travel dates and number of guests and rooms, you'll then be provided with a list of available hotels along with the url to the booking.com website

The second is a fully functional ecommerce site populated with inventory from the fake store api
This website uses React and Redux along with Firebase authentication
You are able to browse the selection of items, register an account, login using the newly created account and add or remove items from your cart.
